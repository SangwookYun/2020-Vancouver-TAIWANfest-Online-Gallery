We pretend to see nothing - ignoring people who cry or get silenced.\n
We choose to say nothing - despite seeing people who panic or scream.\n
People are free to hear nothing, see nothing and say nothing.\n
But, when the freedom is lost, people may have to live a life of feeling terrified, doubtful, silenced or a life involving constantly screaming, crying or panicking.

var text2=`A Taiwanese artist who immigrated to Canada during her high school years, but as she wasn’t allowed to draw or paint in Canada, she soon returned to Taiwan to pursue those desires. After she graduated from university in Taiwan, she returned to Canada to absorb the essence of this diverse land.

Art has always been her pride and joy and feeds her spirit. For her, creativity is like asking herself reflective questions and answering them in the process of self-discovery. In recent years, she has been curious about “installation art” and also experiencing the diverse communities in Canada, learning the creative thinking of experts, and accumulating her own creations. Each time she releases a piece, we see “echoes”, “discussions”, “emotions” and “habits” between art and people, exploring and dancing with diversity.`

var text3 = `A graduate of the Emily Carr University of Art and Design who specializes in animation, loves movies, and is good at storytelling using images; painting is like a bridge that connects his emotions with life, and his artworks are diverse and are full of creativity and life. With the ability to create 2D and 3D animation special effects, Walter Kao is able to create the unexpected. Maybe artists that can draw were born with a spellbook, and are powerful magicians like Walter.
