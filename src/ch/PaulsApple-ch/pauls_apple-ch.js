                <p>The first lesbian movie I loved was Heavenly Creatures, Peter Jacksonn's sumptuous 1994 fils starring a young Kate Winslet as a dangerously charismatic schoolgirl who enraptures a sallow classmate with her phantasmagoric fantasy world. In the end, they kill the classmate's mother. At age fourteen, that squared with my concept of love: predicated on fantasy, eroticized by power imbalance, likely to end in murder - not so much that of anyone's mother, but more likely of me, by the strength of my own whirling feelings.</p>

                <p>A year later, it was The Incredibly True Adventures of Two Girls in Love, Maria Maggenti's considerably less gothic tale of high school senior Randy (a young, butch Tina from The L Word), who has been sleeping with an older, married woman when she meets Evie, a rich and popular girl who stops at the gas station where Randy works. The movie ends with the two kissing amid a chaotic muddle of class tension, homophobic friends, and angry parents and school administrators. It was a perfect anthem for me at age fifteen, as I had recently begun making out with my rich best friend and was the only out kid in my high school class.</p>

                <p>After that came Bound, Chasing Amy, All Over Me, High Art, and But I'm a Cheerleader. I watched and re-watched all of these movies because they showed me myself. Not only because I was queer and prone to phantasmagoric imaginings - as well as to listening to Patti Smith on repeat, wearing stilettos, and heroin addicition - but also because they reflected and suggested my vision of love: as sexy and codependent, forged in opposition to some external conflict. It's no surprise that both I and the movies I worshiped relied upon a certain kind of high-femme, drug-addled, ambisexual Riot Grrrl iconography. After all, we grew out of the same '90s post-AIDS homophobia, Cindy Crawford-cum-heroin chic, third-wave feminist stew.</p>
