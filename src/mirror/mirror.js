Follow the pigeon within the paintings as it travels through our everyday life. Picasso once used pigeons in his works to express people's longing for peace.

Yen-Chun Lu of Taiwan uses the reflections of mirrors to show the sceneries and the stories that we might take for granted as we hope to connect and reflect on those often forgotten realities. When what has been hidden in the reflection of the mirror can no longer be hidden, any attempt to cover it up can make a conscious person feel distorted or isolated. No one wants to feel left out or alone, regardless of the intention behind it.
